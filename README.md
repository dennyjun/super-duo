# Introduction
Super-duo takes two functional applications, Alexandria and Football Scores (base code provided by Udacity), and takes it to a production-ready state by finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget and adding a library.

# Alexandria
This is a book list and barcode scanner application.

# Football Scores
This application tracks current and future football (soccer) matches.
